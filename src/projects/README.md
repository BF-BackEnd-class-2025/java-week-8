# 🚀 10 Spring Boot Project Ideas – Week 8

Week 8 focuses on learning **Spring Boot fundamentals**, **IoC/DI**, and **REST API creation**.  
These 10 projects are designed to be practical, engaging, and achievable within the week — without
yet introducing databases (use lists or maps for data storage).
